This plugin allows the forwarding of uploaded files to an antivirus scanning application and prevents the upload from completing if there is a virus detected in the file. Use it to prevent users from inadvertently spreading malware or viruses via your Mattermost instance. 

Currently the plugin supports [ClamAV anti-virus software](https://www.clamav.net/) across browser, Desktop Apps and the Mobile Apps. ClamAV is an open source (GPL) anti-virus engine used in a variety of situations including email scanning, web scanning, and end point security. It provides a number of utilities including a tool for automatic database updates. A ClamAV server can be easily provisioned as a Docker container that runs alongside Mattermost. 

**Requirements:**

- Mattermost Server Version: 5.2+
- ClamAV Server access

## Installation

1. Go to the [releases page of this Github repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-antivirus/releases) and download the latest release for your Mattermost server.
2. In the Mattermost System Console under **System Console > Plugins > Plugin Management** upload the file to install the plugin. To learn more about how to upload a plugin, [see the documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#plugin-uploads).

3. Install ClamAV (clamd) for virus scanning. One easy option is to provision a ClamAV container with Docker by running the following command.  Assuming you have already installed Docker, this will download and install the latest version of ClamAV and set up a server with an open port at 3310. ClamAV by default accepts 100MB files, you can change this in the [`clamd.conf`](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav/blob/main/etc/clamd.conf.sample). Visit the [ClamAV Documentation](https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Installing/Docker.html) for further configuration. Mattermost's MaxFileSize default value is subject to change. To ensure that the correct value is set, verify your value at the following link: [Maximum File Size](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#maximum-file-size).  

   If your Mattermost's MaxFileSize is â‰¤ 100MB
      ```
      docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 3310:3310 clamav/clamav:latest 
      ```
   If it is > 100MB
      ```
      docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --mount type=bind,source=/full/path/to/clamav/,target=/etc/clamav -p 3310:3310 clamav/clamav:latest 
      ```
   `/full/path/to/clamav/clamd.conf`
   ```conf
   ...
   # Files larger than this limit won't be scanned. Affects the input file itself
   # as well as files contained inside it (when the input file is an archive, a
   # document or some other kind of container).
   # Value of 0 disables the limit.
   # Note: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage
   # to the system.
   # Technical design limitations prevent ClamAV from scanning files greater than
   # 2 GB at this time.
   # Default: 100M
   MaxFileSize 200M # Match your filezize limit in Mattermost
   ...
   ```

4. Once clamd server is running, configure the plugin in Mattermost to make requests to your clamd instance by going to **System Console > Plugins > Antivirus**. Configure **Clamav Host and Port** to point at your clamd instance, and optionally configure a **Scan timeout in seconds** to set how long it takes before the virus scan times out.  
5. Activate the plugin at **System Console > Plugins > Management** and ensure it starts with no errors.

## Testing

To test your configuration is correct, download an [EICAR test file](https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/) and upload it. The file should be rejected as below:

Upload a regular file to ensure it is processed successfully and posted to the channel.

If there is an error with your setup - check your ClamAV server setup and communication:
